This file discusses the main simialirties and differences of CFD and FEM grids. 


The main difference arises due to nature of problems. They both have nodes, cells, 
faces, zones, Boundary conditions etc. Here is list:


Simialrities:
1. Nodes, Edges, Faces, Cells, Volumes
2. Solver quantities are defined at cell center/vertex
3. Coordinate systems, defined for conveneince. In CFD, this is only for boundary condition 
 and wall motion, but not for cell definition.
4. Material (solid/fluid) definition for every zone (set of connected cells)
5. Internal Boundaries - flow, heat transfer, relative motion, friction etc are defined 
  on such faces.


Differences:

1. Element definition in FEM problems are absent in CFD.
2. Moving/highly resizing domain size in CFD.
